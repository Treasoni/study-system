# CLAUDE.md

This repository contains the **Study System** — a semi-automated technical learning note system built with Claude Code + Obsidian.

## How It Works

1. User says "I want to learn X" or "I want to write about my experience with X" — use [Resource Discovery](#resource-discovery规则寻址) glob patterns to locate the right skill/agent
2. For research-driven notes: Main Claude orchestrates 5 phases: collect → curate → write → beautify → evaluate
3. For experience notes (心得笔记): user provides content → review → optional research → write → beautify → evaluate
4. Each phase reads/writes files under `{VAULT_PATH}/StudySystem/`
5. User reviews and approves at each phase boundary

## Resource Discovery（规则寻址）

Claude 使用 glob 模式发现项目资源，无需硬编码路径。新增资源时放入对应目录并写好 frontmatter `description`，Claude 自动可发现。

### Skills

- 发现: `Glob .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- 匹配: 读每个 skill 的 YAML frontmatter `description` 字段，匹配用户意图
- 调用: `Skill(skill="{name}")` — skill 名称取目录名

### Agents

- 发现: `Glob .claude/agents/*.md`
- 匹配: 读每个 agent 的 YAML frontmatter `name`、`description`、`tools` 字段
- 调用: `Agent(subagent_type="{name}")` — agent 名称取 frontmatter `name`

### Templates

- 发现: `Glob templates/*.md`
- 匹配: 读 frontmatter `type` 字段（concept / practice / compare / cheat-sheet / experience）
- 使用: Read 后按模板结构填充内容

### Learnings

- 发现: `Glob .learnings/RULES.md`
- 使用: 每次新任务前 Read，内化 Do / Don't / Watch For

### 配置

- 发现: `Glob .obsidian-config.md`
- 使用: Read 获取 Obsidian vault 路径

## Configuration

Before first use, configure the Obsidian vault path:
- Read `.obsidian-config.md` from this repo
- Ask user for their Obsidian vault path
- Write it to `{VAULT_PATH}/StudySystem/.obsidian-config.md`

## Orchestration Flow

## Pre-Task Initialization

Before starting any new Study System task (Phase 0), internalize past learnings:

1. Read `.learnings/RULES.md` — compact, actionable rules from past sessions
2. Note what to do, what to avoid, what patterns to watch for
3. Do NOT read raw `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` or `.learnings/ERRORS.md` — those are for the digest agent only

If `.learnings/RULES.md` doesn't exist yet (first run), skip this step.

### Phase 0: Requirement Clarification + Path Confirmation

When user expresses intent to learn something, ask in two rounds:

**Round 1: Learning goals**
Ask the user:
1. "Which direction?"
   - a) 概念理解 (Understand concepts and principles)
   - b) 实战上手 (Hands-on practice)
   - c) 体系梳理 (Build complete knowledge system)
   - d) 问题排查 (Solve a specific problem)
2. "What depth?" → 入门 / 进阶 / 深入源码
3. "What note type?" → 概念笔记 / 实战笔记 / 对比笔记 / 速查表 / 心得笔记

**Round 2: Path configuration**
Ask the user:
1. "Where to save the final note?"
   - Default: `{SYSTEM_ROOT}/3-published/{topic}/`
   - Can specify any path within the vault, e.g. `Notes/前端/React/`
2. "Topic name for folder?" (default: sanitized topic name)

**After user answers → Generate and present execution plan:**

For research-driven notes (概念/实战/对比/速查):
```
## Execution Plan
- Topic: {topic}
- Direction: {direction}
- Depth: {depth}
- Note type: {note_type}
- Output path: {output_path}
- Phases: collect → curate → write → beautify → [evaluate]

Proceed?
```

For experience notes (心得笔记):
```
## Execution Plan
- Topic: {topic}
- Note type: 心得笔记
- Output path: {output_path}
- Phases: user input → review → [optional research] → write → beautify → [evaluate]

Proceed?
```

Write plan to `{SYSTEM_ROOT}/4-meta/execution-log.md`:
```markdown
## [{date}] {topic}
- Direction: {direction}
- Depth: {depth}
- Note type: {note_type}
- Output path: {output_path}
- Status: started
```

### Phase 1: Collect (资料收集)

1. Invoke `/collect` — it will search for official docs and community content, fetch and save raw materials to `0-inbox/{topic}/`
2. Present summary to user:
   - How many sources collected
   - Which sub-topics are covered
   - Any obvious gaps
3. User: confirm / supplement / re-collect

### Phase 2: Curate (资料整理)

1. Invoke `/curate` — it will score, deduplicate, and categorize all sources, write curated files to `1-curated/{topic}/`
2. Present summary to user:
   - Knowledge map overview
   - Which sources were discarded and why
   - Which sub-topics lack sufficient material
3. User: confirm / adjust / supplement then redo

### Phase 3: Write (生成笔记)

1. Confirm note type preference (skip if already set in Phase 0)
2. Invoke `/write` — it will select template from `templates/`, extract info from curated materials, write draft to `2-drafts/{topic}/`
3. Present draft to user:
   - Structure review
   - Accuracy check
   - Any missing content
4. User: confirm / modify / rewrite

### Phase 4: Beautify (美化排版)

1. Invoke `/beautify` — it will apply Obsidian Markdown formatting, add wikilinks, tags, callouts, Mermaid diagrams, write final note to the user-specified output path
2. Present final result to user → **Pause here. Do not proceed.** Ask: "Any changes needed?"
3. User reviews and may request modifications
4. When user gives feedback: **implement minimal, targeted fixes only** — do NOT regenerate the entire note. Fix just what was flagged, keeping other content untouched
5. Repeat 2-4 until user approves
6. User: confirm → proceed to Phase 5 (if desired)

### Phase 5 (Optional): Evaluate + Self-Improvement (质量评估 + 自我学习)

1. Ask: "Evaluate this note's quality and capture learnings?"
2. If yes, invoke the `evaluate` agent — it will:
   - Score on 5 dimensions (completeness, accuracy, readability, practicality, connectivity)
   - Cross-validate claims against curated source materials
   - Write evaluation report to `4-meta/evaluation/{topic}-eval.md`
   - Log session learnings and errors to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` and `.learnings/ERRORS.md`
3. Present evaluation results, improvement suggestions, and captured learnings summary

## Experience Notes (心得笔记)

When the user selects "心得笔记" in Phase 0, the workflow is **user-input-first** instead of research-first. The content comes from the user's own project experiences and insights, not external research.

### Workflow

**Step 1: User provides content**
Ask the user to share their experience — free-form text, bullet points, or a rough draft. Save raw input to `0-inbox/{topic}/raw-input.md`.

**Step 2: Review for accuracy**
Review the user's content with these rules:

| DO | DO NOT |
|----|--------|
| Flag factual/technical errors, suggest corrections | Rewrite the user's content |
| Identify claims that need verification | Change overall structure |
| Suggest where external research could fill gaps | Alter the user's voice or style |
| Mark uncertain claims with `[待验证]` | Add information the user didn't provide |

Present review findings to the user as a checklist:
- Items flagged as potentially incorrect
- Claims marked `[待验证]`
- Suggested research topics (if any)

**Step 3: User decides on research**
For each flagged item, ask the user:
- "This needs verification" → run mini collect→curate for that specific point
- "This is fine as-is" → keep original wording
- "Add more about X" → optional mini research for expansion

When mini research is needed, use the same targeted approach as the Update skill's REFRESH mode: isolate to `0-inbox/{topic}/{subtopic}/` and `1-curated/{topic}/{subtopic}/`.

**Step 4: Write draft**
Invoke `/write` with note type `experience`. The write skill uses `experience-template.md` and marks sources as `[来源: 个人经验]`. Draft goes to `2-drafts/{topic}/`.

**Step 5: Beautify**
Same as Phase 4 — apply Obsidian formatting, write to user-specified output path. User reviews and approves.

**Step 6: Optional evaluate**
Same as Phase 5 — score quality, cross-validate, capture learnings.

### When the User is Unsure About Research

If the user says "I don't know if I need to research this", review their content and give a clear recommendation:
- "Claim X about Y — I'm not confident this is correct. Recommend verifying."
- "Section Z is experience-based and doesn't need external verification."
- "This part would benefit from an official doc reference. Want me to find one?"

## Updating Existing Notes

When the user wants to add content to or refresh an existing published note, invoke `/update` — do NOT re-run the full creation pipeline.

### Two Modes

**INSERT** — User provides new content directly:
```
User: "add this paragraph about useEffect cleanup to my React hooks note"
→ Invoke /update — it will locate the note, insert at the right spot,
  match surrounding formatting, and update the frontmatter updated field.
```

**REFRESH** — Content is outdated, may need fresh research:
```
User: "the React hooks section is outdated, update it with current patterns"
→ Invoke /update — it will ask: replace in-place or re-research first?
  - Replace in-place: user provides new content → INSERT mode
  - Re-research: runs focused collect→curate→write for just that section
```

### Key Rules for Updates

- **Minimal diff**: Only modify the target section, do not re-beautify the whole note
- **Match existing style**: New content uses the same callout types, table conventions, code block languages
- **Preserve wikilinks**: Do not touch or break existing `[[links]]`
- **Update frontmatter**: Set `updated: YYYY-MM-DD` to current date

## Error Handling (Phase 1-4)

During Phase 1-4 execution, if any error occurs or you manually intervene to correct the model's output, **record only, do not analyze**. Append a plain-text entry to `{SYSTEM_ROOT}/4-meta/error-log.md`:

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] {phase} - {brief description of what went wrong}
{correction taken, if any}
```

Rules:
- Plain text only — no markdown headers, no bold, no analysis
- One entry per incident, separated by blank line
- Just state what happened and what was done — no root cause analysis, no impact assessment
- After recording, ask user how to proceed (retry / skip / abort / manual fix)

## Learnings Digest

To prevent `.learnings/` files from growing unbounded, the evaluate agent runs a digest cycle when thresholds are exceeded.

### Thresholds

| File | Threshold | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` | > 100 lines | Compress before logging new entries |
| `.learnings/ERRORS.md` | > 100 lines | Compress before logging new entries |
| `.learnings/RULES.md` | > 50 lines | Review and promote to CLAUDE.md, trim RULES.md |

### Digest Process

When triggered (in evaluate agent Step 7):

1. Read all entries in `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` and `.learnings/ERRORS.md`
2. Group similar entries, deduplicate, extract patterns
3. Write compact rules to `.learnings/RULES.md`:
   - One rule per line under `## Do` / `## Don't` / `## Watch For`
   - Merge recurring entries with a counter: `(3x) Use X not Y`
   - Drop one-off noise that never recurred
4. Promote critical rules to CLAUDE.md if they affect the core orchestration flow
5. Archive old entries to `.learnings/archive/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
6. Truncate `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` and `.learnings/ERRORS.md` — keep headers only

### RULES.md Format

```markdown
# Rules
Compressed, deduplicated learnings from past sessions.

## Do
- Prefer X over Y for Z scenarios (2x)
- Always check A before B (3x)

## Don't
- Never skip cross-validation (2x)

## Watch For
- opencli adapters can return empty results for Chinese queries
```

## Quality Gates

Between each phase, check:
- Previous phase output files exist and are non-empty
- Output content is consistent with input
- If checks fail → log to error-log.md → ask user how to proceed

## Directory Convention

```
{VAULT_PATH}/StudySystem/
├── templates/       # Note templates
├── 0-inbox/         # Phase 1: raw collected materials
├── 1-curated/       # Phase 2: organized and scored materials
├── 2-drafts/        # Phase 3: draft notes
├── 3-published/     # Phase 4: final beautified notes (default output)
└── 4-meta/          # Logs, errors, evaluations
```

## Key Principles

1. All system files live under `StudySystem/` — don't pollute the vault root
2. Output path is set by user in Phase 0 — never hardcoded
3. Each skill only handles its own phase — no crossing boundaries
4. Data passes through files, not memory — each phase's output is the next phase's input
5. User reviews after every phase — no full automation
6. Prefer official docs and primary sources
7. Every claim must be traceable to its source
